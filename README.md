# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Heart Disease Prediction** project! This machine learning project uses various models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and ECG results.

## 📊 Features Analyzed

### 🔹 Demographic
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)

### 🔹 Medical History
- `cp`: Chest pain type (4 values)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)

### 🔹 Heart Function Measures
- `thalachh`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise
- `exng`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

### 🔹 ECG Results
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
- `slp`: Slope of peak exercise ST segment
- `caa`: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3)
- `thal`: Thalassemia (3 = normal, 6 = fixed defect, 7 = reversible defect)
